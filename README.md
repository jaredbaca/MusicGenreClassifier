The goal of this project is to evaluate the accuracy of several machine learning algorithms for classifying music files by genre. Some preprocessing and analysis is done on the data including feature importance, a correlation matrix, and a scatterplot showing the relationship between the 2 most important features.

# Project Structure
The project is a Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to train and compare several classification models from the SciKit Learn library. The most accurate of these models, the Random Forest Classifier, is then used in a standalone application along with a custom built UI in the classifier.py file. Instructions for launching the Classifier application can be found in the separate README file.
