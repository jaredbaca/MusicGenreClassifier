Thank you for checking out my final project for CS677 Data Science With Python! 


# The Jupyter Notebook "Baca_Final_Project_2.ipynb" contains all of project's source code.

# All dependencies are contained in the virtual environment cs677_venv


# To run the standalone classifier application:

	2. Activate the virtual environment:

		conda activate ./cs677_venv

	3. Run the Classifier Python file:

		python classifier.py
